The cave of Plato. **The allegory of the cave** [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_cave). All the aristocratic society is based on this **myth** [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth). 

The neural control facility is the middle ages in our society, is the noble network. Here nobles of low level by the way observed and command by the highest level in this hierarchic do them dirty traffic:

- drug market.
- black market.
- human trafficking.
- child trafficking.
- weapon trafficking.
- organ trafficking.
- war planning.
- corruption.
- **influence peddling** [[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influence_peddling).
- forced prostitution.
- forced labor.
- playing humans as game cards.
- etcetera etcetera.

Remember that allegories are presented in all the classics, and religions. In Catholicism they are the daily bread, *give us this day our daily bread* [[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord%27s_Prayer).  

### General operation of the noble network

**Double entendre** [[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_entendre). To give double meaning to something is obviously used to hide something that is horrible or illegal. Who use double meanings is a criminal. Full stop.
