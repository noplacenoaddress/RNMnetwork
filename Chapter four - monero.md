**Monero** [[1]](https://www.getmonero.org/) is decentralized cryptocurrency, meaning it is secure digital cash  operated by a network of users. Transactions are confirmed by  distributed consensus and then immutably recorded on the **blockchain** [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain).  Third-parties do not need to be trusted to keep your Monero safe. Monero is *totally* untraceable. 

Let's do some considerations before start with a deep dive into this network. First of all **M** is its logotype, simple is the concurrency of the Machine, what we start to explain in the last chapter. But does it can be converted into classical money? Yes for sure here it is the exchange graphic:
