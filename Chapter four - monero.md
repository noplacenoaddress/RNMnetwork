**Monero** [[1]](https://www.getmonero.org/) is decentralized cryptocurrency, meaning it is secure digital cash  operated by a network of users. Transactions are confirmed by  distributed consensus and then immutably recorded on the **blockchain** [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain).  Third-parties do not need to be trusted to keep your **Monero** [[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monero_(cryptocurrency)) safe. Monero is *totally* untraceable.

But it's possible to simply go to a cash dispenser and get euro? Yes it is.

Remember that to get cash from this **ATM** [[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_teller_machine) normally you have to change XMP to LTC, then use a bitcoin debit card and go to the machine to get normal currency money. So people beside this system, people who work in the synthetic telepathy network gain money in various different ways, doing what is called normally an *articulated economic fraud*:
