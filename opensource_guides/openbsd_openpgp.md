# OpenBSD is back! Now with GnuPG

## Another friend, another animal, a gnu.

------

![music gnu](https://steemitimages.com/640x0/https://www.gnu.org/graphics/listen-eighth.jpg)
And yes, this gnu is *special*. First of all is a capital letters **GNU**, he likes [free software](https://www.gnu.org/), and our special one also like **electronic music**. But not only *free software*, he is specialized also in privacy, he can be the **guardian** of our privacy! Because one of the hottest applications in this wonderful *GNU world* is [**GnuPG**](https://www.gnupg.org/) a mature piece of *open source* software:

> GnuPG is a complete and free implementation of the OpenPGP standard as defined by RFC4880 (also known as PGP). GnuPG allows you to encrypt and sign your data and communications; it features a versatile key management system, along with access modules for all kinds of public key directories. GnuPG, also known as GPG, is a command line tool with features for easy integration with other applications. A wealth of frontend applications and libraries are available. GnuPG also provides support for S/MIME and Secure Shell (ssh).
> Since its introduction in 1997, GnuPG is Free Software (meaning that it respects your freedom). It can be freely used, modified and distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License .

## OpenBSD want your pretty good privacy

------

![privacy is like a pretty woman](https://steemitimages.com/640x0/https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59c9789f4f79bc3b7908b511/master/w_960,c_limit/pretty-woman-musical%25202.jpg)
Speaking about *pretty* obviously my first tough is a *wonderful woman*. And doing a simple association my *connected* brain has elaborated this image, a wonderful Julia Roberts singing a song in the set's bathroom of [*pretty woman*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100405/), do you remember it?
But you have to understand that *pretty* have to be also our **privacy** in a **interconnected world**, *the Internet*. Every single man and woman (child i don't think that have to use it) in the world have access to the Internet, but only a little part know how to protect him/her **privacy** from what we've previously named *the privacy cannibals*.
Today we add another friend to our great guarantees of privacy, a cool dude that follow the **OpenPGP** standard that you can freely study reading the [**RFC 4880**](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880).

## Create the perfect pgp keypair with OpenBSD

![perfect pgp keypair](https://steemitimages.com/640x0/https://static.fsf.org/nosvn/enc-dev0/img/en/screenshots/step2a-01-make-keypair.png)
Ok let's go deep and start the configuration of our *GNU PGP*.
Install the software from ports repository:

```
$ rm -rf .gnupg
$ mkdir .gnupg
$ chmod -R go-rwx .gnupg
$ doas pkg_add -U gnupg-2.1.23
```

We've deleted possible previous `gnupg` configuration, recreate the user directory of the program, assign to it the correct permissions and install the version 2 of the `gnupg` collection.

```
$ cat << EOF > ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf
use-agent
personal-cipher-preferences AES256 AES192 AES CAST5
personal-digest-preferences SHA512 SHA384 SHA256 SHA224

fixed-list-mode
no-comments
no-emit-version
keyid-format 0xlong
list-options show-uid-validity
verify-options show-uid-validity

```

Create the *bootstrap* `gpg` configuration file in our previously created directory.

We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

We're creating a **no expiring** master key in our home directory, using `RSA` sign only option with the maximum key size that is `4096 bits` . In `gpg` every key is associated with a user ID, in our case is `npna@protonmail.ch`. Remember to use a strong unpredictable password and to anote and store it in a secure place (*Â¿do you remember what is a pen and what is a paper?*). It's important for the rest of the configuration know the result `keyid`, for our case is `0xAD8E487FF2F05FDE`. Go ahead with the deep configuration:

At last we've created a sub key for authentication purpose. Thanks to the `--expert` option that we've used we can edit **like a pro** our last `RSA` key using the `(8)` option in our `gpg` shell. Follow the commands and we've finished! Don't leave the last `save` if you don't launch it you will loose all! Review the created keys with:

## Export to an encrypted USB stick

------

Ok, we've have created our **4** `gpg2` keys, one master with 3 slaves, *encryption, sign and authentication* .
Let's prepare an encrypted fresh USB stick to backup them!

```
$ doas su

 M        - disklabel(8) man page     z        - delete all partitions
 m [part] - modify partition

Suffixes can be used to indicate units other than sectors:
 'b' (bytes), 'k' (kilobytes), 'm' (megabytes), 'g' (gigabytes) 't' (terabytes)
 'c' (cylinders), '%' (% of total disk), '&' (% of free space).
Values in non-sector units are truncated to the nearest cylinder boundary.

```

We've initialized the USB stick with the **OpenBSD** `fdisk` with a `GPT` partition table and the we add a single `RAID` partition to it with `disklabel`. We use `RAID` because this is the manner that use **OpenBSD** to do it.

```
# bioctl -c C -l /dev/sd2a softraid0  
New passphrase: 
Re-type passphrase: 
softraid0: CRYPTO volume attached as sd3
# 
```

We've encrypted the first partition label of our USB stick with the command `bioctl` that result in the creation of the pseudo device `sd3`.

```
# newfs sd3c

```

Create an `ufs2` filesystem in the pseudo device disk label `c`, that is the one that indicate all the disk. Create a partition where to mount it and mount it!

```
# gpg2 --homedir /home/taglio/.gnupg --armor --export-secret-keys 0xAD8E487FF2F05FDE > /mnt/encrypted_usb/mastersub.key
# gpg2 --homedir /home/taglio/.gnupg --armor --export-secret-subkeys 0xAD8E487FF2F05FDE > /mnt/encrypted_usb/sub.key
# umount /mnt/encrypted_usb
# 
```



# OpenBSD, OpenPGP, Bob and Alice but also a little bit of magic.

Like them, or better *i wish it'll be*, our two friends **OpenBSD** and **GnuPG** continue them relation. [*Last time*](https://steemit.com/openbsd/@npna/openbsd-is-back-now-with-gnupg) we've seen how to install, generate master key and subkeys (*sign, encryption and authentication*) and backup all of them in an encrypted usb stick under **OpenBSD**.

## Export the public key to the Internet

![_Hierarchical trust](https://steemitimages.com/0x0/http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~adrian/630-f04/PGP-intro_files/fig1-12.gif)

To publish our public key to the Internet allowing others **OpenPGP** users establish a secure channel of communication with us (*i know it's not perfect but combined with other technologies it's the state of the art*) we've to export our **public key** 0xAD8E487FF2F05FDE to one the keyserver of the *pgp network* . Let's start with our *shell sex*:

```
$ wget -P ~/.gnupg https://sks-keyservers.net/sks-keyservers.netCA.pem{,.asc}
$ chmod -R 700 .gnupg 
$ openssl verify -trusted sks-keyservers.netCA.pem -check_ss_sig sks-keyservers.netCA.pem
sks-keyservers.netCA.pem: OK
$ openssl x509 -in sks-keyservers.netCA.pem -noout -text | grep "X509v3 Subject Key Identifier" -A1 | tail -n1                E4:C3:2A:09:14:67:D8:4D:52:12:4E:93:3C:13:E8:A0:8D:DA:B6:F3
```

We download the `CA`certificate of the keyservers pool `sks-keyservers.net`
with its **PGP signature** (*.asc file*). We verify it with the [**openssl suite** ](https://www.openssl.org/) and then we extract the *"X509v3 Subject Key Identifier"* and check if it is the same with the one that we've [here](https://sks-keyservers.net/verify_tls.php).

Like you can see we've just added one new directive in our `gpg.conf` file after resolving the pool of keyservers `sks` in a single `ipv4` address. Next we've created a new configure file for `dirmngr` that is the daemon resposible of the access to the **OpenPGP** keyservers

```
$ gpg2 --send-key 0xAD8E487FF2F05FDE
gpg: sending key 0xAD8E487FF2F05FDE to hkp://193.164.133.100
$ gpg2 --fingerprint 0xAD8E487FF2F05FDE | grep finger | head -n 1
      Key fingerprint = 6ACF BE8E 6C24 EA90 3F5B  9F49 AD8E 487F F2F0 5FDE
```

this is the normal command to transfer our `pub`key who owner is `[ultimate] No Place No Address (No Place No Address) <npna@protonmail.ch>`; after some minutes we can search our `public` key in the **OpenPGP** network [here](http://hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net/).

## Encryption using public key is AWESOME

We want to establish a secure communications channel between `npna@protonmail.ch` and `r.giuntoli@protonmail`, without public key encription and signing will give us a lot of headchache. Using it produce this esquema:

![bob and alice](https://steemitimages.com/640x0/https://www.usna.edu/Users/cs/wcbrown/courses/si110AY13S/lec/l26/asymmetricencryption.png)

In practice never Alice or Bob have to send in an insecure channel, like *Internet*, their private keys. In my example alice got a **Gentoo** workstation, and Bob an **OpenBSD** one. The two folks have uploaded their `public` keys using the **OpenPGP** suite. The two `trust` each one and can verify the fingerprint of the other utilizing a *secure* channel, like they are in the same room creating this example.

So we search the `public` key of Alice in the `keyserver` , in this case we've got only a possible key, we select pressing `1` at the **OpenPGP** shell. Next we enter in `edid` mode and always at the **OpenPGP** shell and we see that also Bob have created three *subkeys* one for **encryption**, another for **signing** and the last for **authentication**. We print the fingerprint to validate it with Bob to locally sign it with the option `sign` . We save and the returl to the `bash` shell.

We do the same process in the Bob **OpenBSD** machine:

Alice encrypt and sign the message *Ð¯ ÑÐ¾ÑÑ Ð²ÑÑÑÐµÑÐ¸ÑÑÑÑ Ñ ÑÐ¾Ð±Ð¾Ð¹* for Bob. The process is simple, she piped it to `gpg` that is launched with:

1. `--armor` the result of the process have to be always text.
2. `--sign` she sign it with her `subkey` dedicated to the sign operation.
3. `--ecrypt` she encript it.
4. `-r Bob` the message will only readable by Bob (*that seems to be russian*).
5. `-` it indicate to `gpg` that the text in input was piped.

Now she use a **free past service** to upload it to the *Internet*, the result is there:

[ghostbin free past service, a message for you darling](https://ghostbin.com/paste/28fqm/raw)

So Bob is very exited and want to rapidly verify and decrypt his *love message*:

With the **OpenPGP** suite we can also simply encrypt a file or folder.

But *Bob* want to be more [**31337** ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet) and want to hide a *secret message* in an image, embedding in it using a technology knowned as [**Steganography**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography). And with **OpenBSD** is a nice and rapid task.

To obtain this little *magic*, Bob install **steghide** from the official ports of **OpenBSD**, next he write a text message and embedded protected with a password in the `jpeg` image.

Now he saves the `jpg` image in his harddisk with `gpg` and `symmetric` encryptions. When he will send to *Alice* he will decrypt it and reuse the `public` method.

```
