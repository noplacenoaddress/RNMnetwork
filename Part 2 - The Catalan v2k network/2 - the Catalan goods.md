# The Catalan's goods	

![Bingo augusta Badalona](../Images/1527747317_noticia-1.jpg)

This is a recent shoot of the **bingo** [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bingo_(card_game)) **Augusta** [[2]](http://www.rodriguezvillar.com/bingo-augusta/) in **Badalona** [[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badalona). You can play the bingo game or do sports betting. But we've said before that people bet over network's victim. And yes, i think that many bets are mask beside other legals bets. Like the ones we find here, in the bingo club.

Why I speak about Badalona, because i know him there and i love this city, little tourism and the wind smell like **Andalucia** [[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andalusia). 

### The Catalan metaphor about greyhound racing

![Greyhound turn](../Images/Greyhound_racing_turn.jpg)

In Catalunya the medium high class society play the game of remote parimutuel betting that i've described in the part one. 

But they don't bet about dogs, or what so ever animal. They bet on humans. And i'm a victim of. It's a tunnel without end where you don't have any relation, you loose all your friends, also your family play and, in my case, a girl that i'm was in love to act like she need help.

And i've done four thousand kilometers by foot in the city of Barcelona.

I've resisted to all kind of brain washing system, gang stalking, threat and rape. Guns on my face. Motorbike accident. And so on and i will explain better all of those fantastic events in the part number four. 

And i received every day any type of threat in radio frequency.

They say that they sell her like a prostitute. But she doesn't call me. 

And time is past. And i cannot wait more. Two years has past. Five years that i don't see her. But because seven years ago i've said "i love you" for me is sufficient to have done all of this.

**But it's only about bet**.

What i want to explain here, dear reader, is how Catalans bet in this shit. They compare dog breeds to humans. *Could you tell me if am I a dog sons of bitches?*
