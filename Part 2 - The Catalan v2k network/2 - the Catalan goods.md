This is a recent shoot of the **bingo** [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bingo_(card_game)) **Augusta** [[2]](http://www.rodriguezvillar.com/bingo-augusta/) in **Badalona** [[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badalona). You can play the bingo game or do sports betting. But we've said before that people bet over network's victim. And yes, i think that many bets are mask beside other legals bets. Like the ones we find here, in the bingo club.

Why I speak about Badalona, because i know him there and i love this city, little tourism and the wind smell like **Andalucia** [[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andalusia).
