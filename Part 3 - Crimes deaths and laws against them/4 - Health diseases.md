# Health diseases 

![ELF radiation health](../Images/radiation_health.jpg)

The remote neural monitoring network got a lot of health diseases that could ruin target individual's life that could be presented to a penal court:

- **Brain tumor** [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_tumor)
- **Alzheimer's disease** [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease)
- **Cognitive deficit** [[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_deficit)
- **Hypopigmentation** [[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypopigmentation)
- **Vestibular schwannoma** [[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestibular_schwannoma)
- **Breast cancer** [[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer)
- **Skin cancer** [[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_cancer)
- **Infertility** [[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility)
- **Blood brain barrier** [[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood%E2%80%93brain_barrier) disruption

Another type of disease that can be taken in front of a court is the **Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder** [[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder) caused by radio waves exposure. The worst point is that this deficit is classified by governments as **mental disorder** [[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder) of the **neurodevelopmental** [[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodevelopmental_disorder) type. Those types of disorders affect the development of the nervous system affecting **emotion** [[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion), **learning ability** [[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardized_test), **self-control** [[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-control) and **memory** [[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory). 

> *In my personal experience as target individual I notice that I'm loosing a lot of learning ability, remember to protect always your brain and body with the correct goods to deny the remote neural monitoring radio waves acting over you and recuperate those humans abilities. It's important to underline that corrupted medics could add to your medical record use of drug or psychiatric medication in front of analyze in a correct way our around electric radio.* 

### Sleep deprivation

![Effects of sleep deprivation](../Images/Effects_of_sleep_deprivation.svg.png)

**Sleep deprivation** [[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_deprivation) in the neural control network it's obtained by electronic torture. With dream injection it's also possible to completely write in our brain dreams that are prepared like a movie and streamed directly to our mind. 

Forced sleep deprivation it's considered a torture and if prolonged it can cause various compartmental distortion in the victim and can fall into **narcolepsy** [[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcolepsy) that is a **long-term neurological disorder** [[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurological_disorder).  This kind of disorders could fall into death.

Those are the illness provoked by this torture:

- **Irritability** [[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritability)
- **Amnesia** [[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesia)
- **Yawning** [[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yawn) as a nervous **reflex** [[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflex) provoked by **stress** [[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology))
- **Hallucinations** [[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination)
- **Immunodeficiency** [[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency)
- Risk of **type 2 diabetes** [[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_2_diabetes)
- **Hypertensive heart disease** [[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertensive_heart_disease)
- **Tremor** [[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tremor)
- **Myalgia** [[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myalgia)
- **Obesity** [[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity)
- **Growth hormone deficiency** [[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hormone_deficiency)
- **Hyphotermia** [[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia)

![Glucosa](../Images/2.png)

Speaking about diabetes in my case from November 2017 when I was "opened" to 18 of December 2019 my **blood sugar level** [[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar_level) have grow to abnormal level falling near diabetes levels.

This is an irrefutable proof that *I'm being tortured* in the Spanish fascist remote neural control network by nobles families in front of all the citizen because all of them in Spain are under active control and have been tortured in Catalunya by the Franco regime.  

Who is it possible? With radio frequency torture under the magnetic bell it's possible to directly affect the functions of internals organs.  

In my case I can directly fell like direct current or near direct current feelings in those organs:

- **Pancreas** [[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas) (this is why I've got high glucose levels)
- **Lungs** [[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung)
- **Kidneys** [[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney)
- **Penis** [[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_penis)

Acting over those internals organs I fall into dysfunctions that flow into diseases. With electronic torture it's possible to silently slowly kill a human; and I'm victim of the Spanish and Italian high class nobility. Why? Because I'm victim of child trafficking I'm under neural control from all my life, they have try to kill me with a lot of car and motorbike accidents, they are torturing my ex girlfriend, my love, Saray,, they have play me like a card game under a virtual casino of remote parimutuel betting system  and now they are killing me slowly with torture. 

I need help from International police and services. I'm a human not a guine pig.
