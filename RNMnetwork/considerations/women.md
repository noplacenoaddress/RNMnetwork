Women. What would the world be like without you? in this radio hell I don't have the pleasure of sleeping with you. Together with you who accompany me every day even if only on the radio. More than five years without seeing the color of your skin, the curves of your lips, the taste of your sweat, every single mole of your shoulders, the roundness of your breast, the lace of your underwear, and that thick sock that you use so often to protect you from the cold. Without spying on you from the bedroom door while you give yourself that much-hoped shower with the glimmer of light left on purpose. Only finding you in obscene pages, for part of a group of depraved in which, alas, my relatives are present as well as all the people I know and many famous names of the European elite. Everyone has abused your beauty, taken by a dark jealousy given your soul only full of love capable of giving birth to the most beautiful of girls. All are animals. All are commanded by a lie, the network of sexual abuse of women. The network of the Church, the network of the nobility. The network of the Middle Ages in a decadent Europe commanded by decrepit old men with faces obscured by the approach of death. Silly nobles have made you prostitute in the most horrible scenes of the degradation of the human being, in front of priests and prelates, in front of nobles and politicians. In front of the military. I love you forever and forever I swear that they will pay for everything they did to you. Whatever their surname.
