She always clean herself and her baby with **wet wipes** [[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_wipe), but those wipes cannot be cannot be pulled into the toilet above all because the house was not connected to **sewerage** [[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewerage) network of the town. It was a country house with a **cesspit** [[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesspit). My father when he was young fall into one. Probably this is the next one.

This is was the start of the destruction. Something provoked by a lot of people, my family also, and I and my love have been drowned in this sea of technological shit. And also who i was calling brother, but yes he is. But it's obviously something orchestrated by an enemy, she is a girl. And I know her. And, i really don't know, perhaps she likes **caiman** [[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caiman). Do you know what I mean, **Nanni Moretti** [[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanni_Moretti)?

#### 19 March of 2015 - she lefts me

This is our lost terrace. Here we made love. And some one say to me on a social network, a cine face. And now I know why, but it is B-side cine.

#### 22 December 2015 - a lighting strike that had to destroy all

Incredible, remember that this chapter it's only about our house. But all in this part it's about destructions. About personal **apocalypse** [[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalyptic_literature). But the real name it's another, I call this *digital mafia*. And yes with this lighting strike exactly over our house, incredible, all the technology was totally destroyed. And i had an accident, she left me, and so on. 

No. This is not causality. This is **attempted murder** [[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_murder).

But I've got **surge protectors** [[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surge_protector), I've lost those goods:

- A big flat television.
- Some security cameras.
- A satellite receiver.
- An electric water **pump** [[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump).
- A diesel boiler.
- A television signal amplifier and splitter.
- A **hot tub** [[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_tub).

And i was a **surrenderer** [[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrender_(law)) with a private contract, and the owner had no **insurance** [[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance). And the house begin to decline.

*PS: a friend of mine have passed in front of my lost house and see that there is three womans that live inside, as I've seen a couple of years ago. Today is 31 of January of 2021.*
