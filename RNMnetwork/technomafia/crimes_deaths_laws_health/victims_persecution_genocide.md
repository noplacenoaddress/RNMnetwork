# Victims of persecution genocide

![California demand](http://telecomlobby.com/Images/remote_neural_monitoring_network_crimes_genocide.webp)

This front page above is the demand of an American association captained by CEO **Cyrus A. Parsa** [[1]](https://www.amazon.com/Cyrus-Parsa/e/B07WPWXTCJ%3F), probably a secret service related man, versus the big tech giants that use the remote neural monitoring network to develop with human guinea pigs. 

One showcase of the "Illuminati" facility reading the website of the **AI organization** [[2]](https://theaiorganization.com/) could be the **global artificial intelligence network** [[3]](https://global-ai.network/). A web page without content. 

The compliant are:

- Misuse of artificial intelligence, cybernetics, robotics, biometrics, **bioengineering** [[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_engineering), **5G** [[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G) and quantum computing technology.
- Endangering the human race with the misuse of artificial intelligence technology.
- Transfer of ai weapon technology to China.
- Violations of **genocide convention** [[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide_Convention).
- Social engineering of the human race with artificial intelligence.
- Bio-digital social programming of the human race by use of their biometrics and artificial intelligence.
- Brain washing humanity with artificial intelligence coding and algorithm **bias** [[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias).
- Cultural genocide by misuse of artificial intelligence.
- Breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
- Defamation.
- Fraud and intentional deceit.
- Breach of privacy.
- Violation of the **Nuremburg code** [[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Code).
- Creating an artificial intelligence system that can recognize and decode if humans are resistant to artificial intelligence.

This demand was filed by the **Clerk, U.S. district court southern district of California** [[9]](https://www.casd.uscourts.gov/clerksoffice.aspx) on 16 December of 2019. This demand if versus **Google LLC** [[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google), **Facebook Inc** [[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook,_Inc.), **DeepMind Inc.** [[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepMind), **Alphabet Inc.** [[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.), **Neuralink Inc.** [[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuralink), **Tesla Inc.** [[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.), **Larry Page** [[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Page), **Sergey Brin** [[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Brin), **Sundar Pichai** [[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundar_Pichai), **Marc Zuckerberg** [[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg), **Elon Musk** [[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk), **PR NewsWire** [[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PR_Newswire).

The points the AI organization declare are true, but not the companies versus. Those companies are in reality clients of the remote neural monitoring facility that I describe in part one. The demand speak about a compensation of 2.3 **Trillions** [[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trillion) dollars.

> *The "Illuminati" facility is headed by Francesca nephew of an Italian hero of the second world war. And she is the real person to denunciate.* 

In reality the center of the entire operation is the return of Fascism at international scale. This is the true.
