*"All roads lead to Rome"*, a medieval **proverb** [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proverb). 

This is only my two cents, don't go crazy dear fellows. 

The telephonic prefix of Rome's province is 6. In the *world backwards*, that is how they explain meanings in subliminal voice service in the remote neural monitoring network, 6 is 9. In binary 6 is 00000110 and in the *world backwards* that is in my opinion the logical operator "not" is 11111001 that in decimal is 249 and in hexadecimal is F9.

Speaking about the telephone prefix, 9 is south Italy, **Sicily** [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicily), **Calabria** [[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calabria), some province of **Campagna** [[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campagna) and a province of **Puglia** [[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apulia). Color is hexadecimal is #fdde9d and in **common name** [[6]](http://chir.ag/projects/name-that-color) is **Cherokee** [[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherokee).
