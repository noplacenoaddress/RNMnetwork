*"All roads lead to Rome"*, a medieval **proverb** [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proverb). 

This is only my two cents, don't go crazy dear fellows. 

The telephonic prefix of Rome's province is 6. In the *world backwards*, that is how they explain meanings in subliminal voice service in the remote neural monitoring network, 6 is 9. In binary 6 is 00000110 and in the *world backwards* that is in my opinion the logical operator "not" is 11111001 that in decimal is 249 and in hexadecimal is F9. 

> *The 249 IP A class is a good target to understand something more about.*
