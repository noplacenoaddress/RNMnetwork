*Have you recognized anything in my DNA? Send me information to Mossen Anton Miret 10 2/1 08810 sant Pere de Ribes.*

In the last fifteen years in Internet there is a few web applications that are used worldwide to do research about **DNA** [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA). This acid molecule carry **genetic** [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics) instructions that could be used by humankind to study **heredity** [[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity), that in humans is passed generation between generation with **sexual reproduction** [[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_reproduction). 

The study of heredity or bloodline could help a citizen, like me, to understand if he pertains to a noble family o to various. That is the reason why I start studying it. To understand who I am and why in the remote neural control facility I've been persecuted from November 2017 and a lot of semi fatal randomness more that I've lived in my incredible life. I start to studying it also to help the woman that I'm love to, Saray. Another victim of this facility, this time probably for her surnames. In my case the **surnames** [[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surname) doesn't help but I've learned with my bloodline and some somatic characteristic that for sure I pertain to a very important noble **lineage** [[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineage_(genetic)). And this why they have electronic torture me.

Now that I'm fighting for my rights in the neural network I've learned a think, a think that I've got to share with you, my readers, to understand how to choose the right way in a common situation. Never fall in the stalking washing machine:

*never pass to be an abused to be an abuser*. 

This is so important and remember that nobles use the art of deception something that derived from the Catholic allegoric figure of the **forbidden fruit** [[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbidden_fruit). Church is totally implied in the gang stalking business. The technological B-side. The digital mafia. Almost all is connected with bloodlines. 

### 23andMe results about Riccardo Giuntoli DNA

![23andMe](http://telecomlobby.com/Images/23admMe.png)

**23andMe** [[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/23andMe) is a **Silicon Valley** [[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley) private company working on **biotechnology** [[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotechnology) and **genetic genealogy** [[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_genealogy) obtained by homemade saliva test received by customers using standard post services.

They execute **salivaomics** [[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saliva_testing) over the sample received that have the goal to complain with a **genealogical DNA test** [[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genealogical_DNA_test) to estimate **ethnic** [[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group) and **ancestry** [[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancestor) of an individual. 

![Salivaomics to 23andMe](http://telecomlobby.com/Images/20200306_095628.jpg)

I've send my saliva sample on 6 March of 2020 to a company dedicated to the stocking and delivering of medical test among others services. The company is **Movianto** [[16]](http://movianto.com/) and the delegation is in Netherlands. From Netherlands. Than it was delivered to US and next the sample was subjected to **DNA extraction** [[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_extraction).  

In the first image you can appreciate the ethnic estimation of this private company. Here there are **ethnic group** [[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group) that DNA speaking they share similar **gene pool** [[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_pool), them groups and sub groups:

- Southern European 82.6%
  - Italian 71.1%
  - Greek and Balkan 2.5%
  - Sardinian 2.4%
  - Spanish and Portuguese 2.0%
  - Broadly southern European 4.6%
- Broadly European 2.0%
- Western Asian and north African 0.8%
- Unassigned 0.3%

All are **European ethnics groups** [[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_Europe).

![Haplogroups](http://telecomlobby.com/Images/Haplogroups_europe.png)

Speaking about ancestry it's important to understand the world **haplogroup** [[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup) that are a group of **haplotype** [[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplotype) who themselves are **allele** [[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele) that are what explain **mutations** [[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation) and **phenotypes** [[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype).

In **human genetics** [[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_genetics) two haplogroups are studied:

- **Y-DNA** [[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Y-chromosome_DNA_haplogroup) haplogroup, a **kinship** [[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinship) system known as the male line, or better saying **patrilineality** [[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrilineality). 	
- **mtDNA** [[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mitochondrial_DNA_haplogroup) haplogroup, that is inherited from the female line, the **matrilineality** [[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrilineality).

Haplogroups are labeled with letters and numbers like you can appreciate in the image below.

My Y-DNA haplogroup is the **R-U152** [[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_R-M269#R-U152) and my mtDNA is **W** [[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_W_(mtDNA)).

### MyHeritage results about Riccardo Giuntoli DNA

![Ethnic groups](http://telecomlobby.com/Images/20200427_132224.jpg)

**MyHeritage** [[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MyHeritage) is an online genealogy platform based in Israel. On 28 of December 2019 they receive my salivaomics and got the laboratory results on 9 February 2020.

The ethnic estimation is very different from the other company. And this is very strange. Salivaomics was send as the other with normal post office service. But as the other I've got all the genealogical DNA data to download in a public URL.

![MyHerigage ethnic](http://telecomlobby.com/Images/myheritage-etnics.jpg)

As you can see in Spanish language them explication of my DNA is the one that I explain here:

- **Telecom Lobby - possible reasons** [[36]](http://www.telecomlobby.com/neural_network/barcelona/my_experience/reasons.htm)

Reasons of this difference could be that ethnic groups are only approximated or that one of the twos samples was manipulated. Remember that I used **Correos** [[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correos) so if the results was manipulated it can be only from a very powerful hand and I don't add anything else.

The results from the crown could underline some bloodline common with the Spanish crown, but I really don't know. In the neural network someone speak about it.

> I will go ahead, I promise.
