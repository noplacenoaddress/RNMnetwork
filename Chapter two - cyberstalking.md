# Cyberstalking



![Cyberstalking](/home/taglio/Work/The%20true%20about%20gangstalking/Cyberstalking.jpg)



In the last twenty years, gangstalking has evolved and it has evolved very rapidly using IT technology and telecomunications, touching what is knowed as **cyberstalking** [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberstalking) or **cyber gangstalking**. Normally in a gangstalking crew there's a lot of **hackers** [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker), **crackers** [[3]](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/C/cracker.html) and **ham radio** [[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio) telecomunications experts, like **satellite** [[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite), **ELF** [[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremely_low_frequency), **ULF** [[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_low_frequency), **WPT** [[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_power_transfer), **HF** [[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_frequency), **VHF** [[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_high_frequency) and **UHF** [[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_high_frequency). 

**Neuroscience** is another gangstalking IT branch. With the grow up of **BCI** [[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain%E2%80%93computer_interface), and the fall down of the price of them with **Arduino** [[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino) and other **open hardware** [[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_hardware) solutions, **neuroscience** [[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience) is now low cost. 

What in the **cold war** [[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War) was patented by US researcher with various acronym like **V2K** knowed also as "voice to skull" [[17]](https://sites.google.com/site/targetedindividuals101/home/v2k) or "infrasound" [[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrasound), **MKULTRA** [[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra), knowed also as CIA mind control program, **TMS** [[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_random_noise_stimulation), transcranial magnetic stimulation also in remote, and **NLP** [[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-linguistic_programming), neuro-linguistic programming (see also methods [[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_neuro-linguistic_programming)) synthetic hypnosis , could be found in my personal repository [[23]](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1p_ZjYQu33qaeZTE89Ae48biWiBG9EPcK) and it is actively used by gangstalker and hackers. Also in wikileaks we can found some information more about those technologies. 

But is gangstalkers connected to the US secret services and goverments? No, probably not. It's very common that they are using the public patents and leaks from Julian Assange [[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange) team to build the synthetic telepathy network.



### The synthetic telepathy network



![Synthetic Telepathy](/home/taglio/Pictures/D-3AgjKX4AE3QX2.jpg)



Let's analyse device by device what is the synthetic telepathy network that is changing in my opinion all Europe and is determining a right turning in our goverment. It's very dangerous and probably it's the start of what i think it could be a **neo nazism** digital dictature and a start of a alpha stage of what we found in Internet named as cyberwar.

The synthetic telepathy network is described in real world by methaphores, or what is called nowadays as memes in Internet. 

- **Target:** For the gangstalkers and for the network administrator is a "M"achine. What does it mean? Simple; in gangstalking for example, but it's valid in a lot of services more that are implemented by network administrators, a family of militaries connected with the Italian Navy based on Genova, every machine has an identificator, an id to witch in a VPN virtual private network there's a correspondence with a control manage system with a lot of devices remote controllables by various iot or so on. A "M"achine, later i will explain teory and technology about this death device, could be shared by many clientes, usually humans but also animals.
- **Target in reality**: one or more persons that doesn't have access to the administration of his "M"achine, s/he loose totally her/his privacy and all the time passed without access is considered like a slave. Many times she/he is also considered only like an object, they use to do experiments with the person to archieve data under extreme stress, violent sex situations and brain experiments. The target individual is a human guinea pig.
- **Target in metaphore**: Is a dog, gangstalkers consider a target individual with the same rights of an animal. They give her/him orders, deny to her/him every types of drets, electronically punish her/him and hit her/him. So did practically all the persons connected to this system because if they doesn't torture the victim they loose privilege in the network and return to the victim state that is the initial state when you forces to join this hell network. In Barcelona Spain i think that there are more than two hundred thousand clients connected.

### Services brinded by the synthentic telephaty network



### Crimes and internationals laws about gangstalking and gaslighting

Is gangstalking and gaslighting only related to drug debt or another kind of debt? Absolutely not. And this is another reality that no one speak about. In fact who fall down in the gaslight vortex has very few opportunities to survive without commit suicide to himself. Who fall down in that word of shit will be threated like a dog, like an animal, like an **human guinea pig**. A person that is connected to the network in the infographic upon will lost eleven articles of the **Universal Declaration of Humans Rights**:

- article 1: all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. [...]
    - when a victim is inserted in the synthetic telepathy network, aka gangstalking and gaslighting network, lost is freedom because of the lost of privacy. Stalkers first of all can read his mind, see what he see via his brain in a sort of man-in-the-middle attack between the auditory and visual cortex. Can also change what the victim receive about the external world with a sort of data injection attack; voice onfly rewrite, voice carbon copy, augmented reality objects injected and so on. Speaking about dignity and rights when the victim suffer street teather and gaslighting is public humillated and induct to suicide.
- article 2: everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, [...]. Furthermore, no distinction shall be made on the basis of the political, jurisdictional or international status of the country or territory wich a person belongs, [...].
    - why victim loose the second article is the same motivation of the first
- article 3: everyone has the right to life, liberty and the security of person.
    - also this article is destroyed when it speaks about liberty and like the second is for the reasons explained in the first.
- article 4: no one shall be held in slavery or servitude: slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms.
