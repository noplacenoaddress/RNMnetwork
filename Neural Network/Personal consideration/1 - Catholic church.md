This is a zoom on the left side street map of the Vatican city. There are some point of interest speaking about radio in the meaning of this technology is very important for the catholic church as we have speak about in some chapter before:

- **Marconi radio center** [[1]](https://www.wikiwand.com/it/Radio_Vaticana), the Vatican headquarters of the homonymous radio.
- A street that remember the **Pope Pio XI** [[2]](https://www.wikiwand.com/it/Papa_Pio_XI), because he inaugurated the radio in 1931 with **Guglielmo Marconi** [[3]](https://www.wikiwand.com/it/Guglielmo_Marconi). This Pope was very connected to Fascism and Nazism. The radio was assigned to the **Jesuits** [[4]](https://www.wikiwand.com/it/Compagnia_di_Ges%C3%B9) in a second time. Jesuits have contributed to the study of magnetism.
- Under the avenue Radio you can appreciate a garden named "français", the owner of the remote neural monitoring network has got root in France.
- On the right under a tower of the old walls you can appreciate the central the head office of the Vatican radio.

What I want to underline to you, reader? Simply, Vatican city is full of radio technology. But those are as usual my two cents.

This is the Vatican Radio principle building but the important think to notice is the antenna in the background. Is an antenna that transmit in MF wave longitude. Medium frequencies are what is used to transmit subliminal messages direct to skull like we've already studied. This antenna is exactly the same that we've reported in Palau de Plegamans in Catalunya. Those are responsible of those messages using the US patent technology. Probably the new digital system perhaps is only remote EEG better saying brain wave transmitted by ELF software defined radio.
