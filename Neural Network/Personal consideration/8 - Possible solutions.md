# Possible solutions

Solutions to a complex problem like what I've lived are various and touch various organs: state, Church and nobility. The first solutions is to keep calm and not loose mental lucidity. To not fall in the gang stalking washing machine to not pass from an abused to an abuser. This is absolutely imperative.

### Catholic Church

![Marriage](http://telecomlobby.com/Images/cropped-wedding-in-rome-amanda-and-salvatore.jpg)

My persecution start when I was 35 years old. 

From when I was fifteen years I always have been with a girlfriend. In my life I've said I love you to three girls.

In the **hypothesis** [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis) that all is about the Catholic Church and is because my mother have decided that I've to be a priest the first and more beautiful solution that I can think about is **marriage** [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage) using the Catholic **sacrament** [[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrament). 

Now it's obvious that I don't have any girlfriend because of this persecution, but I'm still in love with the woman that I've try to catch up. Her name, as you know, is Saray.

She is already married but not in the Church. If your read me, sweetie, I will like to say to you that I love you. 

> Would you married me?

If this is not possible, now, after **COVID-19 pandemic** [[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic) and after I finish to write about what happen to me in Spain from 2017, a democratic European state, I will rejoin normal life and society and without any doubt I will find a job a start a new life. 

> Without any doubt sure monarchy of Spain?

Another possible solution to go away from the neural network could be present to the Catholic Church a petition to be **excommunicated** [[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excommunication). 

First of all I live in Spain but I'm Italian. But I've got  residence and nation identification document of Spain. 

To be excommunicated, **apostasía** [[6]](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostas%C3%ADa) in Spanish, the step to follow are very easy and clear:

- Call to the Church where you receive **Baptism** [[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptism). Ask for a certificate. In my case I've called  on 6 of May 2020 at 18:55 to the **Church of Santissima Annunziata in Sturla** [[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_the_Santissima_Annunziata_in_Sturla), Genoa and speak with the current priest a man that I've known in the past when I was an adolescent in the same city. Very curious but true.
- Get a certified photocopy of your national identity document.
- Fill this **document** [[9]](http://www.telecomlobby.com/Download/Mod_doc_Apostasia_PR_2009.pdf) with the correct data.
- Send them by **registered letter** [[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registered_mail) and with acknowledgment of receipt to your **diocese** [[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese). In Spain you can find your in this **map** [[12]](https://conferenciaepiscopal.es/iglesia-en-espana/mapa-eclesiastico/).
- **Here** [[13]](https://apostatar.wordpress.com/experiencias-por-diocesis/) you can find some experience from others citizens. 

![Tribunale della Rota Romana](http://telecomlobby.com/Images/1371457330772.png)

Another possibility, that almost no one known is to use the Vatican tribunal. It's named **Roman Rota** [[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Rota). It is very simple to contact using them web page:

### State

As this is a complex problem, and it enveloped a lot of state organism with corruption and **code of silence** [[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omert%C3%A0), is difficult to bring to the surface completely. 

The solution that we can use is the strategy **divide et impera** [[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_and_rule).

First of all it's imperative to use public justice, because corruption is rampant in the salons of lawyers in suits. Remember that who are behind the neural network facility, nobles and higher, are who had give us, citizens, the instruments to live in freedom with democracy. They give us the **constitution** [[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution). The A-side instrument to fight against abuses of a deep unknown but not hidden B-side state. What we can analyze as *games* of the nobility cast. And Spain is a monarchy so *nobility is very strong*. But citizens are stronger if they fight together against those games, or better saying criminality, using those instruments.

I've got my personal experience where this B-side criminality put me from being a telecommunications business man to be a target individual. But probably the real think is that my parents were who give me this destiny using me as a human guinea pig, but perhaps they are not guilty but the noble caste itself, supported by the Catholic Church, was who put me in this cesspool; in fact, my dad always gave me clues in his life like **Hop-o'-My-Thumb** [[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hop-o%27-My-Thumb) did in the **fairytale** [[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histoires_ou_contes_du_temps_pass%C3%A9) by **Charles Perrault** [[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Perrault).

So what I've got to do?
