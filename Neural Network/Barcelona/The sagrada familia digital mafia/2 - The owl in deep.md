# The owl in deep

Who is? Where I know him? Why he is so important to have a dedicated chapter? 

Dear, you know why I'm doing it sure? Yes without any doubt.

So let's speak about one of the most incredible man that I've known in my life. I don't know if I have to put him in jail, but I consider that effectively he is in the untouchable circle, or I've to play a little bit more with him to do what my zodiac sign indicate, Aries, that obviously could be interpreted has a battering ram, **better saying** [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battering_ram) that doing this I want to obtain that he opens his doors to a good working site. Other interpretation, and I write it to him because I don't know if he is so focused that all the people that are reading this in the neural control network will loose one of them most important right: freedom. But in reality I don't write this for him because yes he is very focused I write this for all the others because a lot are only a piece of shit and nothing more. But shit people are also utilized by nobility to obtain different goals and probably they are here because they've seen a lot and now they're only **garbage** [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage). And they even cannot understand English so I translate it for them in the network with this man that is "rolling on the floor laughing". 

> *#rotfl like an hashtag, #bofh like the other.*

This man is very complex and because for sure for him knowing me in person was a work, but I think also a pleasure, he speaks with me about his past life letting me glimpse. What does it means:

> *To see something or someone for a very short time or only partly.*

He had presented me some old photos that I've recollected from where we live for a short time when he went out. Obviously with **hindsight** [[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindsight_bias) all was machined. One image is the one above. What I've found and what conclusions could I do about him, but in reality it's not about him it's about what he want that I learn about us. Because for a reason or for another we're strictly connected. Because this man stay with me in neural network every day and every night and I think that his time is really precious and this could be a proof that yes we are. Someone could considers him a stalker, but no I don't think so. What I think that yes his judgment in this network is very dangerous but not in my case because I think that he already know the final verdict, but this is only my two cents.
