Time has passed from when the first **monopoly** [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_(game)) **board game** [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_game) was published. The principle difference between **Carcelona** [[3]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqfx5GPecAE), the augmented reality environment directly injected to our visual and auditive cortex in Barcelona, and these game is that here there are not any manual and targets individuals reduced to small narcos or prostitutes forged by the remote neural monitoring network have not buy or better saying contracted any service. We're forced to join in. We're forced to be a bitch or a narcos by slavery. Electronic harassment slavery.  

*And institution know it, because in these hell there is a principle think: corruption.*
