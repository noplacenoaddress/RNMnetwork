# Carcelona

![Monopoly](../Images/01-This-Is-What-the-First-Ever-Monopoly-Game-Looked-Like-courtesy-Thomas-E-Forsyth.jpg)

Time has passed from when the first **monopoly** [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_(game)) **board game** [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_game) was published. The principle difference between **Carcelona** [[3]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqfx5GPecAE), the augmented reality environment directly injected to our visual and auditive cortex in Barcelona, and these game is that here there are not any manual and targets individuals reduced to small narcos or prostitutes forged by the remote neural monitoring network have not buy or better saying contracted any service. We're forced to join in. We're forced to be a bitch or a narcos by slavery. Electronic harassment slavery.  

*And institution know it, because in these hell there is a principle think: corruption.*

What is Carcelona?

It's a mixed reality environment where people that pay for this service play as in the board game. Where who doesn't pay is a target individual slaved in a parimutuel betting system and inducted to suicide, like me. 

Who are target individuals in Carcelona?

I can speak about four categories:

- Beggars: submitted to electronic harassment tortures because of development of technology commissioned by military facilities, great tech giants and the same remote neural monitoring facility.
- Entrepreneurs: submitted to electronic harassment tortures because of fraud where they loose their facility. *Like me*. Inducted to suicide to cover up the crime.
- Hackers: slaved by the Carcelona master, the butcher, starved to to get a job for free practically in Carcelona itself. Work that includes going from tortured to torturer.
- Low class Catalans: forced to make a double life they normally work in the small restaurant business, in reality in the virtual environment they are forced to sell drugs or prostitute themselves in transposition. *Like my ex girlfriend*. In this situation over the years the master takes care of teaching them the basics of human hacking to ruin people and move forward with the betting chains. One of the main sources of income of Carcelona and a series of shareholders of the Catalan bourgeoisie or nobles.

Who play in Carcelona?

In Carcelona play high class Catalans, Chinese, Russian, Pakistan and Italians. 

What is the game?

Like in the board game there is houses. 

What kind of houses?

Whores, drug sell house, B&B rent, restaurants, discotheques, sex shops, fast food, sales squares, private club, etcetera etcetera.

The most incredible think is that in this remote game play people that are not criminals because is like a video game a sort of **Grand Theft Auto** [[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto). People play to be a criminal, but yes they are and they must be tried in a court for drug sales and exploitation of prostitution as a minimum.

Barcelona is dead, it is like a circus, it has been sold in board game these two figures, the butcher and the purple little bitch. They are destroying Europe.

How they gain money?

Those drug and prostitution facilities are divided in actions like an anonymous society. They gain a percent in crypt concurrency in the monthly revenue.

Why I speak about this?

Because they have systematically destroy my life, they stole my job and used my infrastructure to open this service in Barcelona. They made the woman I love prostitute and destroyed the city. Everyone must be sent to life imprisonment.
