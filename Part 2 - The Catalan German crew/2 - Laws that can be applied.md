### How to hit hard the pyramid of "Illuminati"

All the girls start the "rise" of this fraud being a sexual slave. What does it mean? That they have to prostitute all the days, they don't gain money, and all the money is divided depending on the position in the pyramid of the different criminals. 

*Mi ex girlfriend was a slave. I love you sweetie.*

This is like **people trafficking** [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking). But this is also **procuring** [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procuring_(prostitution)). All the criminals that are up then the first level of the sexual pyramid, the number four in Barcelona, have to respond before the law. 

But remember, those people that have started being a slave in the first step of the pyramid and suffer brain washing or others techniques and simply believe that "Illuminati" are the new order in a democratic state like Spain have, in my point of view, must be compensated from the state. They are doing a crime but many are coerced by radio frequency threats about their family. Women are threatened with their children. 

The theme is very complex and we've to build an association of cold cuts. To protect who have to be protect in front of the law. An association with good lawyers prepared in this special and vast theme. The fight against a new type of pseudo dictatorship.

In Spain **codigo penal** [[3]](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%B3digo_penal) is the **criminal code** [[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_code) operative in the State. Those are the crimes:

- **Trata de personas** [[5]](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trata_de_personas)
- **Esclavitud** [[6]](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esclavitud)
- **Proxenitismo** [[7]](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxenetismo)

All of them are horribles crimes that destroy **human rights** [[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights). Especially of women and child. And my ex girlfriend is a victim of.

*I love you.*

### How to hit every network of neural control

Like we've already said one of the tower of democracy is without any doubt privacy. In Spain, the country where i live there's a lot of laws protecting this fundamental right of the citizen. Spain is **Europe Union** [[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union). 

- In the **Universal Declaration of Human Rights** [[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights) of 1948 privacy was defended and guaranteed. It says that everyone got the right to protect his **intimacy** [[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intimate_relationship), family, home, **reputation** [[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reputation).
- In the article 18 of the **Spanish Constitution** [[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Spain) the right of **honor** [[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honour), intimacy and personal image.
- **Organic law** [[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_law) **11982** [[16]](https://elderecho.com/ley-organica-11982-5-mayo-proteccion-civil-del-derecho-al-honor-la-intimidad-personal-familiar-la-imagen) 
- **General Data Protection Regulation** [[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) from 25 of May 2018
- Organic law **15/1999** [[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ley_Org%C3%A1nica_de_Protecci%C3%B3n_de_Datos_de_Car%C3%A1cter_Personal) of December 13 of protection of **personal data** [[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data)
- Law **9/2014** [[20]](https://transparencia.gob.es/servicios-buscador/contenido/ley.htm?id=NORMAT_E049216014627&fcAct=2017-10-06T08:44:37.843Z&lang=es) of telecommunications that dictate the facilities of the sector. It give to them public service character and it give them the fundamental background about client's rights. 


This laws if violated could represent fines and penalties and also jail defined by the **article 197** [[21]](http://noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/Penal/lo10-1995.l2t10.html) of the **penal code** [[22]](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%B3digo_Penal_(Espa%C3%B1a)).

So like our visual cortex and auditory cortex and much more brain parts are totally under control in a remote neural control network this laws, those above are the Spanish ones, have to be held en front of a penal **judgment** [[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgement).

Those are the pains:

- prison from one to three years for disseminate facts about a person without their consent, even if they have not participated in obtaining such information.
- prison from one to four years:
  -  Seize documents or personal effects of a person without their consent.
  - Use recording, transmission or broadcasting devices without the individual's permission.
  - Treatment of a person's information without their consent in computer files or telematic records.
- prison from three to five years:
  - It is imposed when the crimes of intrusion and disclosure of information have been committed by those responsible or responsible for the processing of the files, or by their representatives.
  - Disseminate data that reveals the person's race, ideology, religion or sexual condition.
  - Disclose data relating to minors or disabled persons.
- prison from four to seven years committing the above crimes for profit.

The last point is what is break under remote neural control networks. And obviously the pain will be the maximum because for example in my case its two years that I'm below this crime in active, with subliminal voice service activated, and many years more in silent mode, or in **hide** [[24]](https://www.thesaurus.com/browse/hide) like i call it.
