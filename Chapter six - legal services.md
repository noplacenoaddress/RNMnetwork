# The legal services in Catalunya, ideas.

![The Untouchables](maxresdefault.jpg)

I speak a lot about the Catalan territory because i live in this lovely autonomous community of Spain. It's obvious in practice a very high part of the revenue of this criminal network is in the submerged economy, so payments are in bitcoin and there's no legal enterprise that pays his duties to the state doing a big crime to it. So one manner to put in jail the owners, the Illuminati (Italians and fascists), is do what United States have done with **Al Capone** [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Capone) a fiscal investigation like we've see with **The Untouchables** [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Untouchables_(film)), a film by **Brian de Palma** [[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_De_Palma).

So another good investigation practice to put in jail those criminals, the Illuminati (this is the name of this shit), is search for legal companies of investments. I my long way by foot in Catalunya to investigate what happen in this fantastic country from five years from now, i've found relation with:

- Real estate holdings, do you remember the ten years crisis in Spain called **burbuja inmobiliaria** [[4]](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burbuja_inmobiliaria_en_Espa%C3%B1a)?
- **Techno** [[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techno) music industry.
- The IT tech **district 22@** [[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/22@) of Barcelona.
- The contemporary Catalan theater.
- The audiovisual Catalan industry.

But there's also a lot of new type of markets that could use this awesome technology, because, yes it is, it is awesome but used in a wrong way. Doing a little bit of **brainstorming** [[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstorming) applications of this Machine are enormous,  from small business to city administration, and more.

- Interconnected brains to do war game strategies in **Q-zar** [[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-Zar) like ambients. 
- **Virtual tour** [[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_tour) with muscle brain and nerves connected in the real ambient, something like an extreme **three-dimensional virtual tourism** [[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_virtual_tourism).
- People movement control and counter near large surfaces to know what product attracts more customers.
- Legal digital **coworking** [[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coworking) ambient.
- Citizen plague control and on fly patch.
- Port container census by maritime police.
- Support for conventional traffic control.
- etcetera etcetera.

This is only a ten minutes thinking. *Applications are near infinity*.
