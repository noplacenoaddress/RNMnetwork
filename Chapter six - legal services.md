It's obvious in practice a very high part of the revenue of this criminal network is in the submerged economy, so payments are in bitcoin and there's no legal enterprise that pays his duties to the state doing a big crime to it. So one manner to put in jail the owners, the Illuminati (Italians and fascists), is do what United States have done with **Al Capone** [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Capone) a fiscal investigation like we've see with **The Untouchables**, a film by **Brian de Palma** [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_De_Palma).
