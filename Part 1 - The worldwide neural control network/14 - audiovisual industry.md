# The audiovisual industry

So we've got analyzed the radio part of the synthetic telepathy network, what people call "Illuminati". A pseudo dictatorship that has got is principal goal to create technological startup in the IT an audiovisual sector. To develop using humans as guinea pigs.

But we don't speak about one of the most important leaf, audiovisual. 

Let's speak about the infrastructure that is behind this monster.

Normally they use to connect the illegal radio network with a wireless Internet service provider next  using a fiber transport provider next a local exchange data center to connect to a audiovisual facility. Doing this is difficult to trace the exact origin of this traffic because the nature of the **WISP** [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Internet_service_provider) it doesn't have an **AS number** [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(Internet)) so at international level it's like impossible to trace.

This is what they've done in Catalunya and it is a patron to search in all Europe and probably all the world. But in the next part I will explain exactly how they've done it. Here I will speak about protocols, hardware and great productions facilities of **Hollywood** [[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood), **Bollywood** [[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bollywood) and others.

### Telecommunication infrastructure 

Ok, so the first step it's to translate analogue different meters longitude waves into [IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address). This is almost done with software defined radio, but in the past and probably nowadays something is however up and running there was radio ham bridges.

**Packet radio** [[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_radio) was and is a classical solution present in the **Linux kernel** [[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel).

Here is some good links:

- **GNURadio** [[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Radio)
- **Software-defined radio** [[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_radio)
- **Universal Software Radio Periphereal** [[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Software_Radio_Peripheral)

UNRP are a point of interest to develop BRAINnet utilized to silently sniff EEG from victims and inject data into brains.

Some of them implement **direct current** [[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_current) of wireless and those are our favorite products to analyze this hell network from the telecommunications lobby known as **wireless power transfer** [[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_power_transfer). Look at this radios:

- **LFRX DC - 30 MHz Tx** [[15]](https://www.ettus.com/all-products/lftx/)
