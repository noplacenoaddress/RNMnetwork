# Radio infrastructure

![Radio spectrum](../Images/Frq_Band_Comparison.png)

There is a lot of different services join together to create the remote neural monitoring facility. Depending on the layer and  who is the real owner it include hidden services from governments, church, nobles and big facilities. At the lower level, used normally to manage black market, prostitution and betting it is create by the use of open hardware devices and open source programs. 

The **radio bands** [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_spectrum) utilized are:

- Extreme low frequency **ELF** [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremely_low_frequency)
- Super low frequency **SLF** [[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_low_frequency)
- Ultra low frequency **ULF** [[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_low_frequency)
- Very low frequency **VLF** [[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_low_frequency)
- Low frequency **LF** [[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_frequency)
- Medium Frequency **MF** [[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_frequency)
- High Frequency **HF** [[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_frequency)
- Very high frequency **VHF** [[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_high_frequency)
- Ultra high frequency **UHF** [[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_high_frequency)
- Super high frequency **SHF** [[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_high_frequency)

The technologies are a mixture between analog and IP. All is public but no one has recollected all the informations in the same document. The telecommunication lobby manage those services using different layers of anonymity and creating a very deep smokescreen using deception, confusion, false institutions and many people to hide that in reality this whole system derives however from the first fifty years of the twentieth century. And it recreates the Middle Ages in today's democracies. 

### Magnetic, electrical and radio services for the cast

![Power lines transposition](../Images/powerlinetranspotion.jpg)

Medium frequencies are the band utilized by ancient fascism and church to create subliminal message systems that produce sound directly into our head. This is not exactly brain wave but it utilize technology to bypass the auditory system in the humans and also in some animals.

In Spain still exist the infrastructure that use Franco at the time of fascism which ended much later in this state than in the rest of Europe. It fell naturally, practically without violence, in the mid-seventies. All this is synonymous that the ruling class, the political class and a good part of the noble families of this country still have a vivid memory of absolutism, very much alive.

In the Vatican state in 1931 the **homonymous radio** [[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican_Radio) was started which from the first moment had as its objective to bring the word of Christ, that is, of the church of man, all over the world. Attention to these last words, from a technical point of view I want to underline how only from an emitting center, actually one inside the walls of the same micro state and from a nearby appendix, the coverage of the whole globe has been guaranteed for practically a century thanks to a special law approved by the **International Telecommunication Union** [[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Telecommunication_Union) that allows the use of an emission power completely outside the world regulations. In Italy there have been various cases, practically all silenced by the immense power of the Church, of groups of people affected by various types of cancer certainly derived from the powers of their radios.

The enormous emission power of the Vatican center, over 150 Kw, interacts worldwide with **overhead power lines** [[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overhead_power_line), forming what is defined today as **electromagnetic smog** [[15]](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2007/jan/18/guardianweeklytechnologysection4). In reality, this magnetic field as large as our planet is used methodically for the great radio experts in the Vatican, who, given their immense culture, are certainly among the best in the world, to position human beings and other objects within the same field, a kind of ancient global position system and never made public. A scandal.

Using this magnetic field, electricity and others radio features it's possible from to obtain what is called **transposition** [[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition_(telecommunications)), **remote viewing** [[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_viewing) and **out-of-body experience** [[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-body_experience). This is not pseudoscience this is true and the elite has concealed it from citizens for a hundred years.

### The government remote neural control

![Remote neural network](../Images/satcycle3-4_2_orig.png)

Governments has got subliminal voice services and silent brain waves sniff embedded in national operators LTE towers. Satellite constellation network also is used to stimulate MEN cells remotely with a 3GHz radio beam antenna. 

Neural control means that our **electroencephalography** [[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography) it's continuously read without our agree, we've no privacy at all. From the interpretation of the brain waves it's possible to obtain what we see, what we feel, what we smell, our tough. But this is not the worst think, the bad ass feature is that they can write in our brain with remote emissions. They consider mankind like a machine and in this book we try to understand how technology work and what kind of abuses are done in the target individuals collective.

Target individuals are active victim of this facility, victims normally by all of those institutions. The church first of all.

### The "games" network

![Games network](../Images/EOFWNG2X0AA_epp.jpeg)

What are games?

Games are frauds used to mask the real goal of being a target individual. Frauds used to mask who are behind this abuse but also frauds that generate millions of Eur. Frauds that recollect money from:

- Black market management
- Prostitution market management
- Sexual harassment obtained by manipulation of subjects that have fall inside this system
- 

The antennas and ground stations that permit the connection to the human targets are very simple. In this photo taken in Catalunya in a tower from a wireless Internet service provider that bind those illegal services  there are two black ferrite magnetic loop antennas that create with two software defined radios a network below 150Hz. They implement **US patent 6011991** [[15]](https://github.com/noplacenoaddress/RNMnetwork/blob/master/Appendix%201%20-%20Patents/US6011991.pdf) , **4834701** [[16]](https://github.com/noplacenoaddress/RNMnetwork/blob/master/Appendix%201%20-%20Patents/US4834701.pdf) but not only.

The white omnidireccional antenna is operating in MF and it used for subliminal voice services. It implement **US patent  5159703** [[17]](https://github.com/noplacenoaddress/RNMnetwork/blob/master/Appendix%201%20-%20Patents/US5159703.pdf).

The last one it's probably related to an open hardware radar system.

This infrastructure, very simple in design, is implemented by Francesca, nephew of an Italian second world war hero, in Catalunya and all over the world. This infrastructure was mounted where i build my wireless Internet service provider. This is why i fall like a victim in the worldwide neural control network. With this infrastructure Francesca is the owner of the gangstalking service in all over the world. Her nickname in the silent subliminal message chat is "Francese". I personally know her and she is one of the head of the digital mafia lobby.

### The terrestrial positioning system

![3D radar](../Images/istockphoto-1017394876-640x640.jpg)

**3D radar** [[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_radar). It's a positioning system that is implemented in the neural control network. There are two layers of positioning, the official one from military forces and the open hardware one that use SDR hardware that it's called **software defined embedded radar** [[19]](http://ancortek.com/).

Another method to calculate the position of an object or a person with radio wave technology are **ultrasound** [[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound). **Bat** [[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat) use the same method to fly in the night, it's what is called **sonar** [[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonar).
