**To stalk**, a verb with root in [Protoindo European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages) languages, [ancient Greek](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek>) and old [Armenian](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Armenian>). Four possible meanings of this verb:

1. To approach slowly and quietly in order not to be discovered when getting closer.
2. To (try to) follow or contact someone constantly, often resulting in **harassment**. 
3. To walk slowly and cautiously; to walk in a stealthy, noiseless manner. 
4. To walk behind something, such as a screen, for the purpose of approaching game; to proceed under cover.

1. Hunting for game by moving silently and stealthily or by waiting in ambush.
2. The crime of following or **harassing** another person, causing him or her to fear death or injury.	
3. The removal of stalks from bunches of grapes prior to winemaking.

We can appreciate in bold two times words with root in the verb **to harass**, from [old French](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_French>):

1. To fatigue or to tire with repeated and exhausting efforts. 
2. To annoy endlessly or systematically; to molest. 
3. To put excessive burdens upon; to subject to anxieties.

In the last twenty years, gangstalking has evolved and it has evolved very rapidly using IT technology and telecomunications, touching what is knowed as **cyberstalking** or **cyber gangstalking**. Normally in a gangstalking crew there's a lot of **hackers**, **crackers** and **amateur radio** telecomunications experts, like **satellite**, **ELF**, **ULF**, **DC over wireless**, **HF**, **VHF** and **UHF**. But this is only the network part. There's another part and this is the worste one. **Neuroscience**. With the grow up of **BCI**, brain computer interfaces, and the fall down of the price of them with **Arduino** and other **open hardware** solutions, neuroscience is now low cost. 

What in the cold war was patented by US researcher with various acronym like **V2K**, voice to skull or **syntethic telepathy**, **MKULTRA**, knowed also as CIA mind control program, **TMS**, **transcranial magnetic stimulation** and **digital hypnosis** that could be [found on the internet](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dYyHmF7aN5sX1TrxHWfHHZgEY1fNxKxf?usp=sharing) is actively used by gangstalker hackers.
