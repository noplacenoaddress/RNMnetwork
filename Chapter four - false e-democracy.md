As you can see there's a pyramid structure in this graphic, so, it's simple, it's a fraud. And electronic democracy *it's not democracy*. I remember my father telling me about his sense of **claustrophobia** [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claustrophobia) inside the **Giza pyramid complex** [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giza_pyramid_complex), also this illness could be classified as **anxiety disorder** [[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety_disorder). Look at the second last step before **e-democracy** [[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-democracy), it's **big data** [[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data) analysis. All of this data in the synthetic telepathy network has grow up a lot. In this criminal network there's absolutely no **privacy** [[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy). And privacy is one of the most important towers of democracy. Where's no privacy there's no democracy.

First of all all people that connected with the service of remote neural monitoring has got their mind read, auditory cortex and visual cortex first of all. What's happen? People are like remote video cameras! All in their line of sight is uploaded to the computing center, could be this in **Switzerland** [[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland)
