In fact who fall down in the gaslight vortex has very few opportunities to survive without commit suicide to himself. Who fall down in that word of shit will be threated like a dog, like an animal, like an **human guinea pig**. A person that is connected to the network in the infographic upon will lost eleven articles of the **Universal Declaration of Humans Rights**:
