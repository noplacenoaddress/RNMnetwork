In Barcelona on the summit of a hill that dominates all the Catalan capital there is what in the underground city's **slang** [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slang) is known as "la nau", "la nave", "the ship".  A white small house similar to the colors that we found in **Athens** [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens) on whose roof it dominates a **Coptic cross** [[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coptic_cross).  On the right side you can appreciate the main mast of the allegorical ship, a telecommunication tower which exactly resembles the mast of a **cruise ship** [[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_ship) that in fact *is* a telecommunication tower.

A Coptic cross is associated with Coptic Christians or better **Copts** [[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copts). This **ethnoreligious group** [[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnoreligious_group) that speak historically the **Coptic language** [[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coptic_language) the latest stage of the **Egyptian language** [[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_language).

In the wikipedia article about the Coptic language on the right you can appreciate this symbol, that in the ancient Egypt was interpreted as the **eye of Horus** [[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_of_Horus). In the "Illuminati" fraud, that in reality is a digital pseudo dictatorship that is destroying our democracy, this symbol is often use as what is called the **third eye** [[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_eye), that has got mystical and esoteric concept to deflect the attention of an investigator and to subdue weak minds in order to make them become slaves as sexual as being **drug dealer** [[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_Dealer).  This is fraud take it root on Internet from the end of the nineties and has Genoese families as theorists. This fraud is a paramilitary group that has got hackers as soldiers.
