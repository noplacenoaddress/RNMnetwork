In Barcelona on the summit of a hill that dominates all the Catalan capital there is what in the underground city's **slang** [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slang) is known as "la nau", "la nave", "the ship".  A white small house similar to the colors that we found in **Athens** [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens) on whose roof it dominates a **Coptic cross** [[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coptic_cross).  On the right side you can appreciate the main mast of the allegorical ship, a telecommunication tower which exactly resembles the mast of a **cruise ship** [[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_ship) that in fact *is* a telecommunication tower.

A Coptic cross is associated with Coptic Christians or better **Copts** [[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copts).
