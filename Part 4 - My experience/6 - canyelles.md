*They have separated us. They have forced our tears. All of this to play with your body, to sell you like in a butcher, to gain to earn slips of paper or magnetic states of a hard disk. To gain with one of the worst think in the world, gambling. ludopathy for mentally ill people.*

*They have separated us. They have forced our tears. All of this to play with my mind, to sell my extreme stress data to military facilities, to gain to earn slips of paper or magnetic states of a hard disk. To gain with one of the worst think in the world, gambling. ludopathy for mentally ill people.*

*Your friend, lover, man and husband if God will help us.*

Here it is our lost house. our love nest. Do you remember sweetie? Our bohemian nights. The fogged glass, the caresses of tenderness.

They have stole our love, but here, in radio frequency, we still in. I will help you to escape to this shit of pseudo dictatorship based on rape of heart's people. Done to create inducted prostitutes and small drug seller or indigents. 

I've seen a photo of you, I've seen three hundred photos of you, I've seen your naked body. They have violated your beauty. The body of a woman is the most important secret that have to be grated only to the man that she loves. No to all those pigs with their penis in their hand. No one can gain nor one Eur over the body of a woman. No one. No one.

### A chronological history of disasters 

We was happy, but she was nervous. But sometimes she lets her soul see. And she was not what people thought about her. She was, and is, who I love. Full stop. But there's something more, something that overshadow her being a woman, something from which she escaped. Something she needed to scream for help.

And now i know what is. This chain of suicides and provoked familiar disasters. The Catalan remote parimutuel  betting system. The remote neural control network. The synthetic telepathy network. The destroy of our democracy. A system where she is a protagonist, where she is a victim. A system where they use her body and violate her soul. But she didn't tell me. She was afraid of. And she escapes.

After that they take me all my bikes and my cars i don't know how to move from my house that was five kilometers from the first bus stop.
