# Squatting

![Okupa](../Images/Okupayresiste.jpg)

To squat:

-  to position yourself close to the ground balancing on the front part of your feet with your legs bent under your body. The same position used when you defecate using a **squat toilet** [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squat_toilet). A type of toilet derived by the ancient **pit latrine** [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_latrine) found on country side. Or in the so-called **third world** [[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_World) (*slavery*).

**Squatting** [[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squatting).  **Anarchism** [[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism)? 

Yes it seems to be. What is behind? Nobles. B-side.

Better say, in monarchies to squat is a normal verb to say and have got a lot not written rules. Are them not written? Perhaps.

But kindly it exist also in the utopian form, but I really don't know.
