# Squatting

![Okupa](../Images/Okupayresiste.jpg)

To squat:

-  to position yourself close to the ground balancing on the front part of your feet with your legs bent under your body. The same position used when you defecate using a **squat toilet** [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squat_toilet). A type of toilet derived by the ancient **pit latrine** [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_latrine) found on country side. Or in the so-called **third world** [[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_World) (*slavery*).
- to live in an empty building or area of land without the permission of the owner. But this is the dictionary definition. This is not true. As usual the world is always the same. Normally those properties are in reality from nobles families or from the church that utilize the punk movement to obtain B-side workers. In reality they assume a rent in B-side money: **bitcoin** [[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin).

**Squatting** [[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squatting).  **Anarchism** [[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism)? 

Yes it seems to be. What is behind? Nobles. B-side.

Better say, in monarchies to squat is a normal verb to say and have got a lot not written rules. Are them not written? Perhaps they are written in old mediaeval's manuscript. 

But kindly it exist also in the utopian form, but I really don't know.

From a OSINT point of view what is our preferred tool to analyze those properties: the **cadastre** [[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadastre). Another great tool is the nobility book that every country had where we can find the real nobles families.
