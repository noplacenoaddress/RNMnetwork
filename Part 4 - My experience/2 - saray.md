All of this. All of this fight. All of this, it's to reclaim your rights my sun flower. Your rights ahead the law. Your rights as a wonderful woman that i've known on December 2012.

*And that is our story, sweetie.*

When i first meet Saray, this is her name, she is serving in a terrace in front of a bar near Marina street, Barcelona. The same street where one of the "Illuminati" had opened another 40 meters ahead. She was mommy a year earlier.

She was working in the restaurant of his husband and I start to go there after that who I was calling brother go there every day. She was beautiful and i when i stop to work at twelve to eat something always i was going here. 

We start to meet, i fall in love with her. She was very unsatisfied with her relationship and a little bit depressed because she takes **sedatives** [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedative). Another strange behavior of this woman was that working at the bar sometimes mans go to see her perhaps for casual reports. It was very strange she doesn't look happy to do this. Sometimes she seems to me super exited. 

And now I know why, she was victim of the steam Machine of the neural control network and she was, and nowadays is, continuously masturbated by radio frequency. But seven years ago I didn't know what it was and I couldn't help her. I would have liked to understand what was happening to her, what the sudden changes of character were due to. Because she seemed so worried and nervous many times. Although I immediately knew it was her, the most important woman in my life.

Now I know that two years earlier in 2011 when she was in love with her husband, David, a stalker, a criminal, a human hacker, who I call "the butcher" virtual rape her and put her in the synthetic telepathy network and after he breaks her love story with the father of her son, who i love too, he starts to use her to destroy families, to start the vortex of bet about them life and to induct to suicide them. 

He is an assassin. 

*But I didn't know it. I was an ignorant. I'm so sorry Saray, I'm crying all the days. I'm so sorry sweetie. I'm so sad to not completely understand you. Sorry.*
