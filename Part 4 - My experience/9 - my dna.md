# My DNA

![My DNA](../Images/dna.jpg)

This is my ethnic estimation obtained by a laboratory in United States from a saliva sample sent by regular mail directly from Spain. The laboratory is from an Israel company named **MyHeritage** [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MyHeritage). 

Theoretically I was born in **Genoa** [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genoa) Italy on 31 of March 1981 from Mauro, a man that have origin between **Tuscany** [[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuscany) and **Marche** [[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marche), and Laura, a woman that have origin between **Piedmont** [[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piedmont) and **Veneto** [[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veneto).

Always theoretically my principle **ethnic group** [[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group) had been to be south European and it is. But there is two possible interpretation of those ethnic groups:

1. I'm son of Mauro and Laura and the ethnic group is correct with 73.9% of **DNA** [[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA) segments included in this principle group.
2. I'm not son of Mauro and Laura and I'm victim of child trafficking but they even don't know because of change of babies by a hospital nurse, very often nuns. In the eighty in Europe there was some scandal about this crime that underline the church as the real guilty. Normally there is something behind this fact, obviously. Genoa is a city full of ancient nobles families and mostly owned by the church or institutions connected to it.
3. I'm not son of Mauro and Laura, I'm victim of child trafficking and they bought me in the black market to play with me when I will be a man, just now from 2017. 

In the second and third option the explanation is very simple from DNA. Has you can appreciate the south European group is subdivided into two others leafs, **Iberian** [[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberians) and Greek - south Italian one. In this case it could mean that one of the twos parents had to be from Spain and the other from Greece. Why I say this? Simple it's very important to underline that I've got also 6.4% of DNA segments that pertains to the north African ethnic group and a 16.2% to the Balkan one. Now the key of lecture could be this:

-  In the past in the VIII century Spain was been dominated by the Arabs of north Africa in what was described has the **Umayyad conquest of Hispania** [[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umayyad_conquest_of_Hispania), so the 6.4% is can be connected with the Iberian group and it will form 45.8%.
