# Tortures and humiliations

![Abu Ghraib](../Images/abughraib.jpeg)

This image is taken from the scandal in the **war in Iraq** [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War) about the **Abu Ghraib** [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Ghraib) **torture and prisoner abuse** [[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Ghraib_torture_and_prisoner_abuse). Where **United States Army** [[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army) and the **Central Intelligence Agency** [[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency) commit a series of **human right violations** [[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights#Violations).

Here in Spain, in my beloved country, I suffered the same but less physical violations but all in remote in the neural monitoring network. This facility is used by **Guardia Civil** [[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Guard_(Spain)), the **Spanish National Intelligence Center** [[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Intelligence_Centre) and the military forces. Obviously also nobility has got access to it. The infrastructure that I've perfectly described is opened and is from the Franco dictatorship.

> *But remember that I live in Catalunya and those state forces here are present but there are also others that pertain to the **Generalitat de Catalunya** [[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalitat_de_Catalunya).*

What I've suffered has been visualized by almost all the people that I've known in my life. But no one help me, nor who I've been considered my parents. They was thinking that I will commit suicide or I will go crazy. I'm in perfect health and mental state. God bless you.

Now on 2020 they are playing with my internal organs to produce cancer and others dysfunctions.

This is how I can describe the electronic tortures that I've lived, 2018 was a very bad year next the decrease the power of the tortures and now they are trying to debilitate me.

But this will not happen. 

Those are the tortures that I've suffered:
