Here I'm doing my job. Job that they have stole me. Job that I've created. Job where people work in a legal way. Job that i create to join my passion for telecommunications and my passion for nature. It's not simple. I was so happy.

I am a recognized entrepreneur in the world of wireless IP telecommunications both in Spain and throughout South America. I deal with **infrastructure** [[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure) in areas where large ISP do not have service. I'm also a good professor about this specific technology. But I'm also a wild nature lover.
