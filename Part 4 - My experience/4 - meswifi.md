Here I'm doing my job. Job that they have stole me. Job that I've created. Job where people work in a legal way. Job that i create to join my passion for telecommunications and my passion for nature. It's not simple. I was so happy.

Above the **sant Jeroni** [[1]](https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sant_Jeroni_(Montserrat)) **Montserrat** [[2]](https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montserrat) **massif** [[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massif) in the image above. 

I am a recognized entrepreneur in the world of wireless IP telecommunications both in Spain and throughout South America. I deal with **infrastructure** [[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure) in areas where large ISP do not have service. I'm also a good professor about this specific technology. But I'm also a wild nature lover. 

> *They break my forearm to deny me access to this telecommunications niche.* 

In three years a gain 3500 clients. Like three hundred of big accounts. Then, after my sun flower was forced to go away, i fall in depression and they systematically destroy my life. And I have to demonstrate it. 

All was about a fiber optic connected from a rack of mine in the **Axion** [[5]](http://www.stam.cat/portfolio-posts/torre-axion/) **Tibidabo** [[6]](https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibidabo) tower to a **Vodafone** [[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vodafone) LTE rack. All was because a service contracted without my knowledge. All was about the access of my wireless Internet service provider to this world, the remote neural control network. With my infrastructure a Genoa's woman start to do what is known as the open. The "Illuminati" pseudo dictatorship start here in Catalunya six years ago. And my sweetie was sold as prostitute and i suffer the worst mental brain washing and gas lighting that humankind can image. Also my parents are involved. This is billionaire affair. 

> *And I and Saray will not commit suicide. We need help.*
